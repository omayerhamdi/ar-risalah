# PROGRESS — আর-রিসালাহ

> **যেকোনো সেশনের প্রথম কাজ: এই ফাইল পড়া।** শেষ কাজ: এই ফাইল আপডেট করে কমিট করা।

**Last updated:** 2026-08-21
**Last session ended at:** Steps 1-4 complete. The article page renders and was
verified at 390px and 1440px. Magnific is now connected, so B1 is cleared.
**Next action:** Step 5 — Header, Footer, MobileBar, SkipLink. The SkipLink
already exists in `Base.astro`; the rest are new. After that, Step 6 homepage.
Cover images (Step 10) are now unblocked and can be started in parallel —
generate three first and compare them side by side before doing the other 11.

## Build order (docs/06-claude-code-brief.md §3)

- [x] **Step 0 — Setup**
  - [x] Folder reorganised; duplicates trashed, superseded drafts moved to `_archive/`
  - [x] `.claude/settings.json` permission allowlist written
  - [x] `CLAUDE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `PROGRESS.md` written
  - [x] git init + first commit + push to `github.com/omayerhamdi/ar-risalah`
  - [x] Auto-resume scheduled task created
- [x] **Step 1 — Foundation.** Astro + Tailwind v4. All design tokens into `tokens.css`
      from `docs/03-design-system.md`. Self-host fonts: Tiro Bangla, Noto Serif Bengali,
      Anek Bangla, Amiri, Newsreader, Inter. Bengali + Latin subsets, WOFF2,
      `font-display: swap`, preload the two critical faces.
- [x] **Step 2 — Typography verification.** PASSED — see notes below. Separate step; Bengali rendering is the
      biggest risk. Test page must verify: যুক্তাক্ষর (ক্ষ, জ্ঞ, ঙ্গ, ত্র, দ্ধ, ষ্ণ),
      matra unbroken with zero letter-spacing, Arabic RTL with harakat uncut,
      Bengali+Arabic baseline on one line, no overflow at 320px.
      Fallbacks if broken: Hind Siliguri, Baloo Da 2. **Rendering accuracy beats aesthetics.**
- [x] **Step 3 — Content schema and data.** PASSED — Zod schema in `config.ts` from
      `docs/02-information-architecture.md`. 14 articles + 5 authors in place.
      `astro build` must validate all.
- [x] **Step 4 — Single article page.** PASSED — The most important page. All components born here.
      Do not move on until mobile is flawless.
- [ ] **Step 5 — Header, footer, mobile bar.**
- [ ] **Step 6 — Homepage.**
- [ ] **Step 7 — Archive pages.** articles, categories, topics, authors, research, resources.
- [ ] **Step 8 — Static pages.** about, contact, start-here, for-khateebs, privacy, terms, 404.
- [ ] **Step 9 — Search (Pagefind).** Verify Bengali indexing with যৌতুক, শাশুড়ি, আখলাক.
      Fall back to Fuse.js over `searchKeywords[]` if Pagefind fails on Bengali.
- [ ] **Step 10 — Logo and visual assets.** Logo is hand-built SVG, typographic only.
      **Covers: BLOCKED — waiting on Magnific MCP connection.** Everything else in this
      step can proceed. See "Blocked" below.
- [ ] **Step 11 — SEO, RSS, sitemap, OG images.** OG images are typographic, build-time.
- [ ] **Step 12 — Final audit.** Full checklist in `docs/07-verification-checklist.md`
      and brief §10. Lighthouse results recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Step 3 verification result (2026-08-21)

`src/content.config.ts` loads 14 articles + 5 authors with zero Zod errors.
14 published, 10 pillar pieces, 4 categories, 47 distinct topics, 165 minutes
of reading. Every `authors:` reference resolves to a real author file.

Two notes carried forward:

1. The brief points at `docs/02-information-architecture.md` for the Zod schema,
   but that document never contains one. The schema was derived from the
   frontmatter as actually authored.
2. ~~Content gap: no article carries references or academicResources.~~
   **Corrected at Step 4.** They are not missing — every one of the 14 articles
   ends with three authored h2 sections: দলিল ও রেফারেন্স, একাডেমিক রিসোর্স,
   গবেষণার দিক. They live in the MDX body rather than frontmatter, and
   `rehype-article-sections.mjs` now rewrites them into the design system's
   markup. Nothing needs writing. The frontmatter fields stay optional for
   articles that may want structured data later.

`src/pages/schema-check.astro` was deleted at the end of Step 4. `/type-test`
still needs deleting at Step 12.

## Step 4 verification result (2026-08-21)

The article page renders all 14 articles. Measured on `/articles/jobaner-hifazat`:

- 4 ayah figures, 1 pull quote, 1 research-layer `<details>`, 2 apparatus
  sections — all produced from plain markdown by the three rehype plugins,
  so writers never touch JSX.
- TOC lists 7 argument sections; the three apparatus headings are filtered out.
- Heading order H1 → H2 → H3 with no jumps. Every image has alt text.
  `<html lang="bn">`, 4 elements tagged `lang="ar"`.
- No horizontal overflow at 390px. Desktop reading column measures exactly
  608px (38rem) with the rail sticky beside it.
- Article JSON-LD and BreadcrumbList present, canonical URL correct.
- **JS budget: 4.29kb** against a 25kb ceiling (1.86kb inline + 2.43kb Astro
  prefetch). CSS 14.8kb.

One real bug found and fixed: the skip link was `position: absolute`, so once
the reader had scrolled it stayed off-screen even when focused. Now `fixed` —
verified by pressing Tab at scrollY 2500 and confirming it lands on screen at
top: 16px. Focus ring is `solid 2px #1E5F8C` at 2px offset.

## Blocked — needs the user

| # | Item | What the user must do | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~B1~~ | ~~Magnific MCP not connected~~ | **Cleared 2026-08-21** — Magnific is connected; `images_generate` is available | — |
| B2 | Cloudflare Pages not connected | Connect `omayerhamdi/ar-risalah` in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard | Live deploy only |

Neither blocks the build. Work around them; do not stall.

## Step 2 verification result (2026-08-21)

Checked in the browser at 320px, 390px and 1440px:

- Conjuncts ক্ষ জ্ঞ ঙ্গ ত্র দ্ধ ষ্ণ হ্ম ন্ত্র স্ত্র ক্ত ঞ্চ দ্ভ — all render as single
  shapes. No fallback needed; Tiro Bangla and Noto Serif Bengali both shape correctly.
- Matra unbroken. `letter-spacing: normal` is pinned on `:lang(bn)`.
- Arabic RTL correct in Amiri; harakat fully visible, not clipped.
- Bengali and Arabic on one line share a baseline correctly.
- No horizontal scroll at 320px with the longest compounds
  (ব্যক্তিস্বাতন্ত্র্যবাদ, প্রাতিষ্ঠানিকীকরণ) — verified by measuring scrollWidth,
  and no element extends past the viewport.
- ﷺ (U+FDFA) initially fell back to a system font; the Amiri subset was rebuilt to
  include it and the fix was verified by loading the file's bytes directly
  (105.5px from Amiri vs 123.4px from the system fallback).

Fonts shipped: `tiro-bangla-400` 48.2kb, `noto-serif-bengali-400` 52.8kb,
`amiri-400` 75.0kb. Article page 175.9kb, other pages 101kb. Budget 180kb.

The test page lives at `/type-test`. It is not linked from anywhere.
**Delete it before launch** (Step 12).
